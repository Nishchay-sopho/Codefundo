# Codefundo++ 2019
The main idea for codefundo++ comprises of implementing a mobile based application which will have the following features:

 - An app which will have the latest updated voters list on it. This basically would be the main voting app from where the eligible voters will vote and the results will be declared immediately after the elections.
 - It would basically have access to the Aadhar database( or an equivalent database which has fingerprints and DOB of the potential voters). Once a person turns 18, he/she would be added to the voters list. The person would be able to login to the app with their fingerprint if eligible. The candidates standing in the election would added manually by the Election authorities. A voter can vote only once according to the designed smart contract. After the elections are over, the results are displayed directly on the same app within minutes of the process. 
 - The users can start with the project by simply downloading the proposed mobile application in their phone. Since this is only the prototyping stage, we are only going to build the android application for demonstration purposes.
 - The final application will require the use of Aadhaar database.
 - We would be using a public blockchain like ethereum as a proof of concept to serve the aforementioned purpose.
